Step 1
Convert the input string to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters. 
This standardizes the input for comparison.

Step 2
In Java, I use the `StringBuilder` class to reverse the sanitized string
and then compare it with the original sanitized string.
In Python, I use slicing to reverse the sanitized string and perform the comparison.

Step 3
Java Compile and run `PalindromeChecker.java`. It includes a main method for testing.
Python Run `palindrome_checker.py` directly as it includes a test case in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.

Step 4
The provided solutions efficiently solve the palindrome problem by focusing on string manipulation and 
comparison techniques in both Java and Python.
