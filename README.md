# Level Order Traversal of Binary Tree

The level order traversal of a binary tree involves visiting each node of the tree level by level, from left to right. This approach ensures that all nodes on the same depth are traversed before moving on to the nodes at the next level. It's particularly useful for applications that require processing of tree data in a breadth-first manner.

## Approach

The solutions provided in both Java and Python follow a similar approach, utilizing a Breadth-First Search (BFS) strategy. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the method:

1. **Initialization**: Start by checking if the root node is null.
If it is, the tree is empty, and we return an empty list (or `None` in the Python version).
Otherwise, initialize an empty list (or array) to hold the levels of nodes and a queue to facilitate the BFS.

2. **BFS Traversal**:
    - Enqueue the root node to kickstart the BFS.
    - While the queue is not empty, process each level of the tree:
        - Determine the number of elements (nodes) at the current level (`levelSize`), which is the current size of the queue.
        - For each node at this level:
            - Dequeue the node from the front of the queue.
            - Add the node's value to a temporary list representing the current level.
            - If the node has a left child, enqueue this child.
            - If the node has a right child, enqueue this child as well.
        - After processing all nodes at the current level, add the temporary list to the final result list.

3. **Building the Tree (for testing)**: A utility function `buildTree` is provided to construct the tree from a given level order representation.
4. This is particularly useful for testing the level order traversal function with custom input.
5. It reads values sequentially, using `null` (or `None`) to represent the absence of a node, and builds the tree by assigning left and right children appropriately.
