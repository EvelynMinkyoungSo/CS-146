1. Graph Representation
First model the problem using graph theory where the courses are nodes and the prerequisites are directed edges.

2. Depth-First Search
Use DFS to traverse the graph starting from each unvisited node (course).
1) Marking nodes as visiting whem they are first encountered.
2) Recursively exploring all adjacent (prerequisite) nodes.
3) Marking nodes as visited once all their adjacent nodes have been fully explored.

3. Cycle Detection
During DFS, if we find a node marked as visited (indicating that it is part of the path you are currently exploring) we have discovered a cycle.


4. Algorithm Termination
The algorithm iterates through each course and applies DFS to detect cycles.
When a cycle is detected, it immediately returns 'false' to indicate that all processes cannot be completed.
If no cycle is found, all nodes are traversed and 'true' is returned, indicating that all steps can be completed.

Input Handling
To simplify user interaction, a console-based input mechanism reads course counts and prerequisites directly from the user.
